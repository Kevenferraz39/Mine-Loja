# Ruby E-commerce App

This is a basic e-commerce application implemented in Ruby. The application interacts with an SQLite database to store information about available products.

The main functions of the code are:

- create_database
- create_product
- list_products
- add_to_cart

The code includes an example of how to use the functions. After creating the database and the 'products' table, the user is prompted to enter information about a product. This information is used to create a new product in the database.

Finally, the list_products function is called to display all available products in the 'products' table.

Before running this code, make sure to install the SQLite3 and Ruby SQLite3 (sqlite3) gems.

Here's a quick guide on how to do this:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Type `gem install sqlite3` and press Enter.
3. Type `gem install sqlite3-ruby` and press Enter.

After installing the required gems, you can run the Ruby code to interact with the SQLite database.
